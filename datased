It was another tough day in front of the 
cameras for Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf. 
But if the Iraqi minister of information 
was feeling the strain now that the war 
has reached Baghdad, he certainly wasn't showing it.

Neat as ever in his rimless spectacles, green Ba'ath party uniform and black beret, the man who is Saddam Hussein's mouthpiece continued to spin loyally for his elusive master yesterday.

"This aggression will end in failure," he said, warning 
Baghdadis to beware of rumours and lies. "After its destruction, 
Iraq will remain and it will be led by President Saddam Hussein. 
This regime will not be destroyed by mercenaries."

Enemy troops, Mr Sahaf insisted to the now familiar forest of microphones at his noon press conference in the city's Palestine Hotel, had been hit by Iraqi missiles in the battle around Saddam International airport.

"We butchered the force present at the airport," he announced. But he did not mention any Iraqi casualties.

... His mixture of bombast, exaggerations and lies raises intriguing questions about how much ordinary Iraqis know about what is happening at this fateful moment. Late last week he was still scoffing at reports that US forces were at the gates of Baghdad.

"They have no foothold in Iraq," he told reporters. "We will welcome them with bullets and shoes." Being hit with a shoe is a grave insult in the Arab world.
